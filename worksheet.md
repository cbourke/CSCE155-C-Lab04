1. Run your sine program and compute the following values.

  a) x = 3.1415, n = 1
  
  
  b) x = 3.1415, n = 7


  c) x = 1.5707, n = 1
  
  
  d) x = 1.5707, n = 5
  
  
  e) x = 0, n = 10

2. Try to compute a sine value using a "large" value for 
n, say n = 100.  What value do you get?  Why do you think that is?



3. Play the guessing game at least 3 times to ensure that your 
program works.  What is your best score (that is, least number 
of guesses)?
